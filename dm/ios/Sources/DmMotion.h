// ---- The phone's gyro ----
// A controller mounted on the phone (Backbone One, Razer Kishi, GameSir G8) has no motion sensors of its own: the phone in the middle is the console, as a Switch in handheld.
// So the phone's device motion (gyro + accelerometer, CoreMotion's fused gravity and user acceleration, 100 Hz, no permission prompt) drives player 1's six-axis sensor, turned
// into the Switch frame for the screen's orientation (motion_phone_to_switch, motion_fusion.h): x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player.
// The host keeps phone and controller orientations separately, choosing fresh controller data in auto mode and the phone alone in forced mode.
// DM_PHONE_MOTION: auto (default) while no controller supplies fresh gyro data (a DualSense held apart from the phone uses its own, motion_apple.h), 1 always, 0 never.
// DM_MOTION=0 (all live motion off; the NSP script's --no-motion builds it in) never starts device motion.
// Which frame the samples come in: on iOS 27 and later the pad view (full screen, over the picture) is the motion body (CMMotionManager.deviceMotionBody), so Core Motion delivers
// them in that view's frame for whichever display shows it and however it is turned: x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player, the Switch frame as it is.
// Before that they come in the hardware frame, turned here by the interface orientation, which holds only where the hardware frame is the screen's portrait frame: not on iPhone
// Duo's inner display, whose picture is a quarter turn from it (up / down and left / right swapped, GitHub issue #569). Open: while the scene is not full screen (Split View on the
// inner display) Core Motion falls back to the hardware frame without saying so, and the samples are then taken as the view's frame
